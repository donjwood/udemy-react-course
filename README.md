# Udemy React Course

This the code I have written while following allong with the Udemy [React - The Complete Guide 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course. I have named the folders containing projects with friendly names to help me remember what is in them, but I have also added a course module number before each one. The course module number specifies which module use of that project began in. Some projects were used in subsequent modules.
